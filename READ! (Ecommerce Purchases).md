This Project was achieved with some Fake Data about some fake purchases done through Amazon!

To perform data analysis on this dataset, I have mentioned 15 questions that we are going to solve one by one. Questions are as follows:

1. Display Top 10 Rows of The Dataset
2. Check Last 10 Rows of The Dataset
3. Check Datatype of Each Column
4. Check null values in the dataset
5. How many rows and columns are there in our Dataset?
6. Highest and Lowest Purchase Prices.
7. Average Purchase Price

9. How Many People Have Job Title that contains "engineer"?
10. Find The Email of the person with the following IP Address: 132.207.160.22
11. How many People have Mastercard as their Credit Card Provider and made a purchase above 50?
12. Find the email of the person with the following Credit Card Number: 4664825258997302
13. How many people purchase during the AM and how many people purchase during PM?
